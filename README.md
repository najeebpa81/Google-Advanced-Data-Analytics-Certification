## 📐 The PACE Framework
Every project in this repository follows a rigorous engineering mindset:
1.  **PLAN:** Identifying the business need and scoping the data requirements.
2.  **ANALYZE:** Cleaning, validating, and performing EDA (mirroring the data integrity standards used in Semiconductor Quality).
3.  **CONSTRUCT:** Building and refining complex statistical models.
4.  **EXECUTE:** Summarizing insights for stakeholders and providing clear business recommendations.
